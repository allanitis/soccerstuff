            On every team, defenders are the last line of defense except for the goalie. Defenders have to be able to be quick, calm, and able to take the ball away from, or "tackle" as it is officially called, an attacker. A successful tackle will see the attacker disposessed, but will not foul the attacker. Many defenders will also come up on the attack to aid the attacking players in scoring goals.

              The video nearby is a highlight reel including amazing goal line saves from defenders. These kinds of saves are very rare, and always amazing, as although the goalkeeper has been defeated, the defender has managed to prevent the ball from splashing in the back of the net.

            Gerard Pique is one of the best defenders in the world. Some of his best attributes are his height, speed, and physicality. Defenders need to be fast so that attackers can't just speed past them. He also goes onto the attack for corner kicks. Because of his height at six foot four, he is able to get more height than other people, and he increases his chance of scoring a goal.

          <p class="w3-large">
            Pique is also able to stay calm under pressure. While defending 1 on 1, staying calm and not overcommiting is very important because if you overcommit the attacker will go right by you and score. It is important to just slow the attacker down and let your support get back to help you.
