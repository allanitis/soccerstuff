### Feature Guide

When we created this project, we created a variety of different features to make the website stand out.

| Feature | Why | Pages It Is On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript NavBar | We created a [JavaScript navbar script](https://github.com/joshandjames/joshandjames.github.io/blob/master/script/navigation.js) that fills in the navigation bar on page load. Having a single file do the work makes it easy to change the navbar's contents. Rather than updating every page's navbar, we can just add a link object to the link array in the script. | This feature can be seen on every page. |
| Consistent Look | You might notice that all of our pages look similar. This is because, we used the same page layout for each page. We first made the homepage beautiful and then used the same code again and again for each page while adjusting the page content and format when needed. | This feature can be seen on every page. |
